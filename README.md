# holosemantic

We need to create &amp; establish &amp; maintain a multiscoped holistic semantic system for data objects &amp; actor objects &mdash; codenamed "holosemantic" &mdash; freemium, on premises and in the cloud, completely F/LOSS &amp; fully F/LOSS, all BSD3 licensed.

Multiple scopes should inclide uglocal scopes (where u := universal, g := global), and access control lists (ACLs) scopes, &mdash; in fact, these ACLs represent access control heterarchies of scopes; we need to make an (additive) sum that into per-actor holistic heterarchy AKA per-actor holistic forest; &mdash; Microsoft Active Directory and its alternatives like LDAP and so on to maybe consider in the future.

Server with API, GUI, TUI (allowing for ssh) are planned.

This is the main monorepo with many folders in the root &amp; the navigational /README.md.
