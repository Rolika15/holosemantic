# holosemantic

We need to create &amp; establish &amp; maintain a multiscoped holistic semantic system for data objects &amp; actor objects &mdash; codenamed "holosemantic" &mdash; freemium, on premises and in the cloud, completely F/LOSS &amp; fully F/LOSS, all BSD3 licensed.

Multiple scopes should inclide uglocal scopes (where u := universal, g := global), and access control lists (ACLs) scopes, &mdash; in fact, these ACLs represent access control heterarchies of scopes; we need to make an (additive) sum that into per-actor holistic heterarchy AKA per-actor holistic forest; &mdash; Microsoft Active Directory and its alternatives like LDAP and so on to maybe consider in the future.

This is the main monorepo with many folders in the root &amp; the navigational /README.md.

## Implementation goals

  * multiplatform Server with API;
  * multiplatform GUI client;
  * multiplatform TUI client (allowing for ssh) &mdash; ?in modern tvision/turbovision? &mdash; ?DOS-compatible?;
  * all-in-one standalone multiplatform GUI;
  * all-in-one standalone multiplatform TUI (allowing for ssh) &mdash; ?in modern tvision/turbovision? &mdash; ?DOS-compatible?
  * ?Linux filesystem based on fuse?

are maybe planned.

## Project status

  * Inception/Creating docs
